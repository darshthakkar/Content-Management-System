Content Management System – Own Website – Detailed Resume

# Abstract; Signifying the purpose and scope

Creating a detailed resume helps a third party person to get more information about yourself which, otherwise wouldn’t be possible in a short resume.
I have utilised wordpress resources to develop a content management system which has been designed to display my projects, contact details and my thoughts and aspirations.
This is a good and professional way to give an insight of yourself such as by attaching your website link in your resume.
